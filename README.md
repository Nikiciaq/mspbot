# mspbot
A bot for collecting coins in an online game for mainly children called Movie Star Plnaet, works by looping through all the pictures of animals that give you money and click on them when it finds them.
If you want to use it you need to adjust the code for your resolution and where the folder with your bonnie screenshots  is.
In folder called "ZWIERZAKI" there are already 100 screenshots of bonnies for the bot to look for, but it is ready for new ones so you can add your own.
Enjoy ;p
